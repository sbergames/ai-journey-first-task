Two ways:

1. Download all data using [load_data.py](https://github.com/sbergames/ai-journey-first-task/blob/a2d1c476b116f4af6ca40bcc455a353e1fa080fa/src/load_data.py), but you will need access to the SberGames Google Cloud Big Query project.

2. Or manually download files from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EAZ97AOb5r1vV1oCEizK3p4oFkH8SFt0?usp=sharing) and copy them to the same folders in the repo.
